Fixes log file

2.0.0 (12/1/2025):
--INVENTORY now says you don't need inventory
--THINK conditional text now says "here/at (location)"
--rejecting text command explains things better
--point scoring commands obfuscated (they gave different parser error before, a sort of spoiler, also a bit confusing if the player doesn't figure it out)
--many _ (noun) commands implemented as generic rejects
