Author's Walkthrough for Go-Strange-Ghost Range

by Andrew Schultz

This was a submission to EctoComp Petite Mort 2025, where you had 4 hours to code. Graphics were not counted against the time limit. (Please, no cracks about how they wouldn't have counted much!)

The solution is, in the big picture, fairly straightforward. You need to escape the ghost's grip, then do something in each of the four other rooms, then return to defeat the ghost. This must be done in a specific order, but if you do it wrong, the game leaves the right command for reference in THINK.

The oaf is fully optional. Its mechanics are: OH FADE hides it. OAF AID makes it reappear, but if it's there, OAF AID toggles the level of detail of its help. This is also visible in the status line, where the text is always grey in regular mode, but it's yellow/green (unavailable/available) with OAF AID enhanced.

Dull eyes leave you unable to do anything. Oh, the thoughts they put in your head! You can't leave until you address them directly.

>DUH LIES

Now you'll be able to listen to something new, but you can't deal with it until you're strong enough.

>S

Rue Fear. You feel small and can't see anything.

>ROOF ERE

Okay, you see ways out now.

>S

No trouble? Nothing to see here?

>NOTE RUBBLE

You have a friend now. His not having done too much actually helps with the next bit. Also, you're done in this room and can't go back once you leave.

>N
>W

Cur streets!

>CURSE TREATS

Dude Well-Do-Dwell's laziness rubs off on your canine adversaries, who are now out of commission.

>E
>E

You couldn't have done anything before, as the curs would interfere. But now you can...

>HELP LOTS

With all these people, um, entities to assist you, you are ready for the final bit!

>W
>N

If you listen, the Reap Elegy runs through.

>REPEL EDGY

Everyone does their part, including the oaf, whether or not you summoned them.

And you win!
